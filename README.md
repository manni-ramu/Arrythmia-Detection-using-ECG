1. **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**: Utilized pandas and numpy for data manipulation and analysis. The sklearn's LabelEncoder was used for encoding categorical labels.

2. **Wavelet Transformation**: Applied PyWavelets (pywt) for wavelet transformation, a novel technique in ECG signal processing that helps in noise reduction and feature extraction.

3. **Imbalanced Data Handling**: Addressed the challenge of imbalanced data using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) from the imbalanced-learn library.

4. **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**: Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras with a TensorFlow backend. The model includes Conv1D, AvgPool1D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout, and Softmax layers. The Adam optimizer was used for training the model.

5. **Model Visualization**: Used Keras's plot_model utility to visualize the architecture of the model.

6. **Regularization**: Applied Keras regularizers to prevent overfitting.

7. **Data Visualization**: Used Matplotlib for data visualization, which is essential for understanding the data and model performance.

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of signal processing, machine learning, and deep learning techniques, as well as proficiency in Python and its data science ecosystem.

GitHub Copilot: 1. **Data Analysis, Preprocessing, and Transformation**: The code begins by importing necessary libraries for data manipulation (numpy, pandas), visualization (matplotlib), and transformation (pywt for Wavelet Transformation). It also prepares for handling imbalanced data using SMOTE from the imbalanced-learn library. These steps are crucial for any machine learning project and demonstrate a strong understanding of data analysis and preprocessing techniques.

2. **Deep Learning Model Implementation**: The code imports Keras, a high-level neural networks API, to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model includes Conv1D, AvgPool1D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout, and Softmax layers. It also uses the Adam optimizer for training the model. Regularization techniques are applied to prevent overfitting. This shows proficiency in implementing and optimizing deep learning models, a highly sought-after skill in the field of AI.
